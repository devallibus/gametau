# Gametau Contributor Agreement

Thank you for contributing to Gametau!

By submitting a pull request or any other contribution, you agree to the following simple terms.

## Copyright & Patent Grants

You grant devallibus a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use your
contribution in the project (including any future versions or commercial offerings).

## Your Contributions

You confirm your contribution is your original work, or you have all necessary rights to submit it.

## Community Fair Play Pledge (appreciated, not mandatory)

If you or your company use Gametau in a commercial game that eventually earns more than $100,000 USD
in lifetime gross revenue, we'd be very grateful if you made a single one-time donation to help keep
the project going.

Suggested amount:

- 1% of lifetime gross revenue from that game
- Minimum $2,000
- Maximum $15,000 per game

You have up to one full year after reaching the $100k mark to make the donation, whenever it feels
right. If circumstances make it difficult, just let us know — we're happy to reduce, delay, or waive
it with no questions asked.

This pledge is optional in spirit. The license remains fully Apache 2.0 either way.

Thank you again — every contribution helps!
