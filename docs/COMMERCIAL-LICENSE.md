# Gametau Commercial License

This is a friendly commercial license for companies whose game using Gametau has earned more than
$100,000 USD in lifetime gross revenue.

## One-time payment

- 1% of lifetime gross revenue from that game
- Minimum: $2,000
- Maximum: $15,000 per game

Payment is due anytime within **one full year** of reaching the $100k mark. You can pay via GitHub
Sponsors (one-time), Stripe invoice, or bank transfer — whatever works best for you.

## What you get

- Written confirmation and peace of mind
- Priority support for 12 months
- Your name or company logo listed as an official supporter (optional)

## The spirit of this

The core library remains 100% free under Apache 2.0 for everyone. This is just an optional paid path
for successful studios who want to support the project that helped them ship.

If the numbers above don't work for your situation, just reach out — we're happy to discuss.
